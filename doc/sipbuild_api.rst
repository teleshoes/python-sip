:py:mod:`sipbuild` Module Reference
===================================

The :py:mod:`sipbuild` module implements the SIP build system.  The module may
be used by project-specific :program:`project.py` scripts or extended by other
build systems.

.. note::
    Most of the classes described here have additional methods and attributes.
    Unless they are documented here they are **not** part of the public API and
    may be changed in any future release.

.. py:data:: SIP_VERSION
    :type: int

    The major.minor.patch version number encoded as an integer.  For example
    v5.4.0 would be encoded as 0x050400.

.. py:data:: SIP_VERSION_STR
    :type: str

    The version number as it should be displayed to the user.
